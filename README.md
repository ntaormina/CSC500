README for module 1 code

In this assignment we were asked to use python to write programs that accepted 2 inputs: num1 and num2.

We then were supposed to add, subtract, multiply, and divide these then output the results.

I chose to combine these two programs into one, because less lines of code is more efficient. If this is a problem for this class,
I won't do it again.

Pseudocode:
1. Take input for 2 numbers and typecast them to integers
2. Add, subtract, multiply, and divide these numbers and set all of those to unique variables
3. output the result of each operation
